# CraFFter
A Final Fantasy XIV craft rotation optimizer using genetic algorithm.

## How will it be done?

 - Implement a crafting simulator.
    - For this one we'll need metrics on chances of each state.
 - Some basic tests to be sure that the simulator is well implemented.
 - First genetic algorithm implementation.
 - REST API to connect it on a website or a mobile app.
